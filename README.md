# Exploring median family wealth in the US (1983-2016)

## *Data*

* The data originally comes from the [Urban Institue](https://apps.urban.org/features/wealth-inequality-charts/) & [US Census](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-income-households.html). This was collated into .csv files as part of the [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) project.

* The above chart explores the median family wealth of US households over the period 1983-2016 split by race.

* The figures have been normalized to 2016 rates so as to make them comparable and not be affected by inflation.

## *Observations*

* The median White family wealth is almost **8x** of that of Black and Hispanic families. Thus, there is a significant disparity in the ditribution of wealth and this has not improved over the years.

* From 2007 to 2010, there was a sharp fall in the median family wealth which was most pronounced for White families. This seems to be driven by the 2007-08 housing market crash and the subsequent recession. 

* Historically, the median family wealth of Black housholds has been higher than that of Hispanic households. However, over the last ten years, this trend seems to be reversing.
